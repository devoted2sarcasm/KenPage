    <h2>Albums</h2>
    <h4>Make Yourself - 1999</h4>
    <p><i>Make Yourself</i> was my introduction to this band, and I was pretty quickly hooked. I first heard 'Drive' on my way to school one morning and immediately committed the name to memory. I later looked up the remainder of the album and soon after that it was the first CD I went and bought. To this day they are some of my favorite songs.</p>
    <h4>Morning View - 2001</h4>
    <p>Their next album, <i>Morning View</i>, was a slight digression from the agressively grungy with a twinge of punk sound that was <i>Make Yourself</i>. It took my a few listens through to really make sense of why I liked it, and it really just boiled down to enjoying the lyrics and the melody. Hearing them change their sound up but still maintain the ability to appeal to your senses was really just a recipe for success.</p>
    <h4>8</h4>
    <p>Their most recent album is next on my list because it just causes me a short sense of beweilderment that they have been doing it for as long as they have, with a couple different band members along the way, but they've never lost their sense of poetry, fun, and certainly sound.</p>
